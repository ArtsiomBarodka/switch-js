              One morning, when <b>Gregor Samsa</b> woke from troubled dreams,
              he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He
              lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he
              could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches
              into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and
              seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully
              thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about
              helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It
              wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little
              too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A
              collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table -
              <i>Samsa was a travelling salesman</i> - and above it there hung a
              picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine
              and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out
              with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur
              muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.
              <b>Gregor</b> then turned to look out the window at the dull
              weather. Drops
